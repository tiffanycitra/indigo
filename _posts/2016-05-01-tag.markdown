Last year, a subset of the team -- which included myself and four other people -- partnered with Microsoft Research and Nobel Foundation. We developed a customized version of TAG for the exhibition ["The Nobel Prize -- Ideas Changing the World"](https://www.nobelprize.org/events/nobel-prize-series/singapore-2015/exhibition.html) in Singapore (2015).

I was responsible for front-end development using Javascript and HTML/CSS, in which I implemented new UI features and fixed multiple bugs. I also had the chance to participate in demo and design discussion with representatives from Microsoft Research and Nobel Media.

Recently, TAG was also used by Massachusetts Historical Society for their exhibition ["The Private Jefferson"](http://blog.microsoftnewengland.com/2016/03/04/bringing-massachusetts-history-to-the-digital-sphere/).

This project is sponsored by Microsoft Research, and supervised by Prof. Andy van Dam.
