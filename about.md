<h2>Hello there. I'm Tiffany.</h2>

<p>I was born and raised in Jakarta, Indonesia for the first 18 years of my life, before moving to Providence, RI to pursue my college education at Brown University.</p>

<p>After switching gears from Geophysics and Engineering, I finally decided to concentrate my studies in Computer Science-Applied Math.</p>

<p>My current interests include data science and interactive data visualization, software engineering, and sustainable development. I ultimately aspire to combine all those interests together, creating value and driving growth in my home country.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading, baking, and planning for my next travel.</p>

<p>I am excited about exploring new things and telling stories, and this website is just one of the few platforms where I attempt to share my thoughts and ideas, as well as some fun projects that I have worked on in the past.</p>

<p>Feel free to shoot me an email at: tiffanycitra95@gmail.com.</p>
